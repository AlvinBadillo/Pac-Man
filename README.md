Pac-Man Game: Welcome to my Pacman Game project! This game was developed using C++ and OpenFrameworks as part of a Programming Assignment for my Advanced Programming Course.

The primary goal of this project was to enhance my practical programming skills by extending the base code. This required a deep understanding of advanced programming concepts discussed in class, particularly inheritance, object-oriented programming, memory management, and graphical rendering techniques.
